Grok for nvim


# Idea 1
  Simple CLI that takes `grok [prompt]` or `grok -i [prompt]` the i flag means interactive, it will save your context from that entire terminal session

# Idea 2
  nvim plugin that acts like LazyGit, can open a window and prompt Grok, it can also provide the current file buffer to give specific context
